#### Saloni Rawat: 

Hi All, 
I am originally from India but did my undergrad in Singapore and have lived/worked there for the past 4 years. I have about 4 years of experience in IT consulting mainly working with HRIT systems. I am extremely confortable using Java, SQL, and Python. I have also worked on an android development to create a e-reader for a SME publishing house.
